# Keystroke Analysis for Authentication

Developed a system for analysing keystroke (Keystroke Dynamics) to authenticate users based on their inherent typing behaviour.

We have made various models using SVM, Manahattan Detector and Neural Networks.
Also developed a basic GUI for generating and retreiving keystroke data.

Our Neural Network is reaching upto 91% accuracy on the test set.
