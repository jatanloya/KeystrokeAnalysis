# Keystroke Analysis for Authentication
This is an attempt to create a biometric based form of authentication using keystroke dynamics which are unique to every person just like other biometric markers like fingerprints


We use two paramaters for analysis as of now: 
1. Dwell Time:

It is the time spent on every keystroke.

2. Flight Time:

Time between successive keystrokes.
